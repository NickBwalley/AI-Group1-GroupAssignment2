# AI GROUP ASSIGNMENT TWO
In your respective groups, suggest one problem for each of the learning methods i.e. Classification 
and Regression. Look for an appropriate dataset to implement the algorithms to solve the 
problems. The work should be done as follows:
## Classification
Identify a problem and an appropriate dataset and implement the classification by using:
  i. KNN Algorithm
  ii. Decision Trees
Compare the performance of the models on the same dataset in terms of accuracy.
## Regression
Identify a regression problem and an appropriate dataset and implement an ANN model to 
conduct the prediction task. 
 ### N/B: All the implementations to be done in python. The code should be well commented at each 
stage.
## Submission Instructions
The submission should include:
  i. The dataset used.
  ii. A pdf document including details of group members, a brief introduction to the 
  problem, and a link to the GitHub account where the implemented code is maintained. 
  iii. Submissions to be done only by group leaders.
